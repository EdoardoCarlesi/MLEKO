MLEKO: Machine Learning Ecosystem for KOsmology 

by Edoardo Carlesi (2020), ecarlesi83@gmail.com


This is a collection of Machine Learning based tools for cosmological simulation data, written in Python.
It uses the usual libraries numpy, pandas, scipy, as well as scikit-learn and tensorflow for the ML part.
It is mostly tuned to work with Local Group simulations of the CLUES project (Local Group Factory, HESTIA)

Mleko means milk in Serbian, which makes the acronym sound nice to a language nerd like me.

I guess anyone but me will find this code hardly useful.
